# Lesson 4: Music & Sound Loops – Make It Play!

**Theme:** *"Code can create rhythm – let's make your sprite sing and dance!"*

---

## 🧠 Learning Focus: The Conscious Competence Cycle

| Stage | Name | Description | Example in Scratch Coding |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Unconscious Incompetence** | The learner doesn't know what they don't know. | A child tries to make music by dragging sound blocks one after the other manually. |
| 2️⃣ | **Conscious Incompetence** | The learner is aware of the concept but struggles to apply it correctly. | They use a `forever` loop with a sound but forget the `wait` → it sounds messy. |
| 3️⃣ | **Conscious Competence** | The learner uses the loop correctly but must focus and follow steps. | They carefully build a music beat using `repeat`, `wait`, and `play sound`. |
| 4️⃣ | **Unconscious Competence** | The learner applies the concept fluently and creatively. | They mix sound, timing, and events naturally and even teach others. |

**Teacher tip:** Highlight mistakes as normal and useful. Celebrate when students recognize and fix them – that’s learning in action!

## Goal

Introduce **sound blocks** and reinforce the use of **loops** by creating music or rhythmic animations in Scratch. Students will experiment with sound effects and loops to build fun, interactive music machines or animations.

---

## Structure (1.5 hours)

### 1. Welcome & Sound Demo (10 min)

::: {.callout-note title="Teacher Instructions"}
- Ask: “What did we do last time with events?”
- Demo a sprite that makes sounds when clicked or plays music on loop.
- Ask: “Can code make music?” → "Yes, with sound blocks!"

### 2. Guided Build – Looping Sounds (20 min)

::: {.callout-note title="Teacher Instructions"}
Guide students through building a sprite that loops a sound forever or repeats it a set number of times.
:::

#### 🔧 Option A: Forever Sound Loop

```
when green flag clicked
forever
  play sound [meow]
  wait 0.5 seconds
```

#### 🔧 Option B: Repeated Beats

```
when green flag clicked
repeat 8
  play sound [drum]
  wait 0.25 seconds
```

### 3. Movement Game: Clap-Loop (10 min)

::: {.callout-note title="Teacher Instructions"}
Play a physical looping game:

- Form a circle. One child claps a rhythm (e.g. clap–clap–pause).
- Everyone repeats it like a loop.
- Change leaders every 30 seconds.

Explain: "You just looped a beat – like a forever block in Scratch!"

### 4. Mini Challenge – Make a Music Machine (25 min)

::: {.callout-note title="Teacher Instructions"}
Let students build a project using sounds + loops:

- A band (each sprite plays a different looped sound)
- A beatbox machine (click different sprites to trigger sounds)
- A music/dance animation
:::

#### 🔧 Optional: Add Events

```
when this sprite clicked
play sound [bass drum]
```

```
when [space] key pressed
start sound [loop beat]
```

### 5. Showcase & Listening Party (15 min)

::: {.callout-note title="Teacher Instructions"}
Turn the classroom into a listening room:

- Let students walk around with headphones or take turns presenting their music machine or beat.
- Ask each child: “How did you use a loop in your song?”
:::

### 6. Wrap-Up & What’s Next (10 min)

::: {.callout-note title="Teacher Instructions"}
Discuss:

- What was fun about using sound?
- Can you imagine creating a sound-based game?

Preview: “Next time we’ll build simple **games** where you use scores and reactions!”
:::

### ✏️ Optional Homework

- Ask students to draw a musical instrument or machine they’d like to code in Scratch.
